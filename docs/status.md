# Project Status: Let's Talk

**Last Updated:** January 2025

**Overall Status:** Phase 1 (Student), Phase 2 (Teacher), and Phase 3 (Admin) core features are complete. The application now has a fully functional role-based architecture with domain-driven tRPC API structure.

_Project stack is Next.js (T3-influenced, monolithic on VPS), Node.js (via Next.js), MySQL, Prisma, tRPC, NextAuth.js. Authentication uses email/password only. Payment for paid courses via manual proof upload by student; admin review is a future phase._

## üöß In Progress / To Do

### Phase 4: Testing, Refinement & Production Readiness

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests for all user flows
- **Performance Optimization:** Database query optimization, caching strategies
- **Security Audit:** Review authentication, authorization, and data validation
- **UI/UX Polish:** Mobile responsiveness improvements, accessibility enhancements
- **Documentation Updates:** API documentation, deployment guides
- **Production Deployment:** VPS setup, CI/CD pipeline optimization

## ‚ùó Issues / Blockers

- **NextAuth Adapter Types:** `@ts-expect-error` used in `src/server/auth/config.ts` and `src/server/auth/index.ts` due to ongoing type mismatches with NextAuth v5 and Prisma Adapter. Monitor NextAuth/Adapter updates for potential fixes. This is a known workaround.

## üîß Recently Resolved Issues

- **Modal Display Issue (January 2025):** The `Modal` component using `createPortal` was causing Next.js hydration problems and displaying only gray backdrops without content. **Resolution:** Replaced the complex `createPortal` Modal implementation with inline conditional rendering using standard React patterns and CSS positioning. Applied client-side mounting checks and simplified modal structure for reliable display across all admin pages. This ensures consistent modal functionality without hydration conflicts.

## üéØ Next Priorities

- **Phase 4: Testing & Production Readiness:**
  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and E2E tests for all user flows
  - **Performance Optimization:** Database query optimization and caching strategies
  - **Security Audit:** Review and enhance authentication, authorization, and data validation
  - **UI/UX Polish:** Mobile responsiveness improvements and accessibility enhancements
  - **Production Deployment:** Complete VPS setup and CI/CD pipeline optimization
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Automated payment gateway integration
  - Real-time features (WebSockets)
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - Mobile app development

## üìù Recent Technical Improvements

- **Authentication Simplification:** Streamlined to email/password only, removing OAuth complexity.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Implemented dynamic data fetching for "Today's Tasks," "Calendar," "Contribution Calendar," and "Recently Accessed Courses."
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Improved mobile responsiveness with React portal implementation.
  - Consolidated user profile management in an easily accessible sidebar modal.
  - Better visual hierarchy with real user data display.
- **Code Organization:** Cleaner component structure with proper modal positioning using portals.
- **Database Enhancements:** Added `releaseDate` and `lastAccessedAt` fields to support dynamic, personalized content scheduling and tracking.
- **Directory Restructuring & Role-Based Architecture:**
  - Implemented Next.js 13+ route groups for role-based access control: `(admin)`, `(global)`, `(student)`, `(teacher)`
  - Enhanced middleware with comprehensive role-based route protection and automatic redirections
  - Reorganized component structure: `ui/`, `shared/`, `student/` with global `Sidebar.tsx`
  - Improved security with route-level authorization and conditional navigation
  - Better code organization with clear separation of concerns by user role
- **Role-Specific Dashboard & Navigation:**
  - Created admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) with platform overview, quick actions, and recent activity
  - Created teacher dashboard (`/teacher/dashboard`) with teaching metrics, course overview, and student activity
  - Created admin course management page (`/admin/courses`) with comprehensive course administration tools
  - Updated middleware to redirect users to role-appropriate dashboards when accessing `/dashboard` or `/courses`
  - Enhanced sidebar navigation with role-based conditional links and proper route highlighting
- **Major tRPC Router Refactoring - Domain-Driven Architecture:**
  - **Router Organization**: Transformed from flat router structure to domain-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns
  - **Domain Boundaries**: Created `student/`, `teacher/`, `admin/`, and `public/` domain-specific router folders
  - **Course Router Split**: Refactored large course router (766 lines) into domain-specific routers:
    - `student/course.router.ts` - Student course operations (enroll, view progress, toggle completion)
    - `teacher/course.router.ts` - Teacher course management (view courses, student progress, management details)
  - **Nested API Structure**: Updated frontend calls from `api.course.*` to `api.student.course.*` and `api.teacher.course.*`
  - **Enhanced Type Safety**: Scoped procedures reduce naming conflicts and improve developer experience
  - **Improved Maintainability**: 78+ files updated across the entire codebase with clear domain separation
  - **Better Security**: Role-based authorization enforced at the router domain level
  - **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: Professional, scalable structure suitable for large-scale applications
